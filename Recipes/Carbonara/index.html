      <p class="text-muted">PS: This is a very unprofessional but delicious recipe,</p>
      <p class="text-muted">I asked for this at a random italian restarurant and this is kinda what the chef told me
        lol.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="instructions">
        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <p>Start making a good amount of spaghetti for yourself. Crack your eggs into a bowl and grate your cheese of
          choice (I use Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Padano),</p>
        <p class="text-muted">// If you want to do original carbonara, then use a mix of Parmigiano Reggiano with
          Pecorino Romano, but I'm not rich like that.</p>
        <p>Stir it so it becomes one yellowish sauce. Add a bit of fresh black pepper and a generous amount of salt.
          This is your sauce,</p>
        <p>After you're done with the sauce, start cutting your bacon block into small cubes and heat up a small pan
          where your will fry the bacon. (I don't use oil for this one)</p>
        <p>After your spaghetti are done, pour out the water, but keep a little bit of the spaghetti water so you can
          use it later if the sauce is too dense.</p>
        <p>Leave the spaghetti in the pot, keep the pot on low heat, put your golden-brown bacon pieces into the
          spaghetti and pour your sauce over it.</p>
        <p>Keep stiring because you don't want burnt eggs at the bottom, you want the final product to not be big pieces
          of egg, but you also don't want it to be raw runny eggs.</p>
        <p>It has to be something inbetween where its a creamy sauce with no raw eggs in it. If the sauce is becoming
          too dense, add your spaghetti water to it.</p>
          <br>
        <h5>Congrats! you made spaghetti alla carbonara from a high-school IT student recipe. Hope it tastes good, and
